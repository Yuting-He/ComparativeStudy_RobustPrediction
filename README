# Application of RobustPrediction to Low-Dimensional Datasets

This repository contains the experimental datasets and original code used in my Bachelor Thesis titled: *Development and Application of an R Package for Hyperparameter Optimization Procedures that Improve the Robustness of Prediction Models*.

## Description

In this thesis, I applied the `RobustPrediction` R package to low-dimensional datasets to evaluate its effectiveness in improving prediction robustness. This study is a comparative analysis based on the research conducted by Ellenbach et al. (2021). The repository includes all datasets and code used in this analysis.

## Repository Contents

- **`comparative_study_data.R`** - Implementation code for constructing the experimental datasets.
- **`compare_data_gap.Rda`** - The low-dimensional datasets constructed using `comparative_study_data.R`.
- **`comparative_study_experiment.R`** - Code for running experiments and generating the experimental results.
- **`results_df_dim7_gap.Rda`** - Stored experimental results for 7-dimensional datasets, which can be loaded and used directly.
- **`results_df_dim15_gap.Rda`** - Stored experimental results for 15-dimensional datasets, which can be loaded and used directly.
- **ZIP files** - Contain some experimental datasets and partial results that were not used in the final thesis.

## Notes

Running the experiments may take a significant amount of time. For convenience, the experimental results have been pre-saved in `results_df_dim7_gap.Rda` and `results_df_dim15_gap.Rda` for quick analysis.
