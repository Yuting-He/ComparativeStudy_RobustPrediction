# Bachelor Thesis: Application of RobustPrediction to Low-Dimensional Datasets

This repository contains the experimental datasets and original code used in my Bachelor Thesis titled: *Development and Application of an R Package for Hyperparameter Optimization Procedures that Improve the Robustness of Prediction Models*.

## Description

In this thesis, I applied the `RobustPrediction` R package to low-dimensional datasets to evaluate its effectiveness in improving prediction robustness. This study is a comparative analysis based on the research conducted by Ellenbach et al. (2021). The repository includes all datasets and code used in this analysis.

## Repository Contents

- **/data/** - This folder contains the low-dimensional datasets used in the comparative study.
- **/scripts/** - This folder contains the original R scripts that run the analysis and experiments, comparing the performance of `RobustPrediction` to other methods.
